/**
 * This class should hold the state and logic of a robot: where it is, which way it's facing , whether it's carrying a pod right now, and whether it has successfully dropped the pod.
 * A Kiva always starts facing UP(one of our provided FacingDirections). not carrying a pod and not having successfully dropped the pod. the move() method prerforms the logic for 
 * any KivaCommand, and the isSuccessfullDrop() method indicates whether the previous command dropped the pod on the drop zone.
